= JProfiler Memory Example

Example code for quickly understanding how JProfiler memory profiling works.


== Usage

. Start project and connect JProfiler with instrumentation
. Go to "Telemetries", "Memory"
. Create objects, _notice how memory usage increases_
. Go to "Live Memory", "All Objects", _notice that 10,000,000 Double objects exist_
. Run GC, _notice that objects cannot be collected_
. Go to "Recorded Objects", _notice that nothing is shown until you start recording_
. Release objects
. Run GC, _notice that memory consumption decreases_
. Record objects
. Create objects, _notice that 1,000,000 Double objects are created (1/10th of real amount, depending on JP settings)_
. Go to "Allocation Call Tree", _notice that nothing is shown until you calculate call tree_
. Calculate call tree, _notice that call tree is based on already created objects_
. Go to "Allocation Hot Spots", _notice that hot spots also have been calculated_
. Release objects
. Run GC, _notice that "Recorded Objects" is updated, while "Allocation Call Tree" and "Allocation Hot Spots" are not updated until you calculate again_


== How to analyze high memory consumption

* Play around with app and monitor memory usage
* Record object allocation when memory usage is high
* Calculate allocation call tree and hotspots
